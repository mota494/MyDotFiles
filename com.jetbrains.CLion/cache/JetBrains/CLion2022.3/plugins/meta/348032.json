This also means you can easily share icon themes with friends. You can also download online <b>icon packs</b> (example: <a href=\"https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-icons-plugin/blob/master/themes/THEMES.md#newuifilestoolduitheme\">restore the old file icons when using the new UI</a>).</li>\n        <li>For more information, please see this <a href=\"https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-icons-plugin/blob/master/docs/GET_STARTED.md\">guide</a>.</li>\n        <li>For questions about the plugin licensing model, how to get a license for free (students and teachers), and how to get a perpetual license, please see the <a href=\"https://github.com/jonathanlermitage/intellij-extra-icons-plugin/blob/master/docs/LICENSE_FAQ.md\">license FAQ</a>.</li>\n      </ul>\n      Extra Icons <b>Chinese UI</b> is automatically applied if you enable the official IDE <a href=\"https://plugins.jetbrains.com/plugin/13710-chinese-simplified-language-pack----\">Chinese Language Pack</a> plugin.<br>\n      如果你启用官方IDE中文语言包插件, Extra Icons中文用户界面将自动应用.\n      <br>\n      <br>\n      📢 Please don't trust the plugin's low rating. It had ~5 stars until I decided to ask for modest financial support starting from March 2022.\n      Some narrow-minded people organized a review-bombing against my plugin (and sent me very aggressive emails, sometimes death threats;\n      seriously... they're crazy), which is why you see many 1-star ratings. JetBrains support accepted to remove most of the toxic reviews,\n      but unfortunately, they refused to remove the 1-star ratings...<br>\n      If you want to help plugin developers, please consider <a href=\"https://youtrack.jetbrains.com/issue/MP-4248\">up-voting YouTrack issue MP-4248</a>.
